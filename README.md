# Ecosteader 

## Ecological Democracy Begins Locally

An Ecosteader is one who recognizes that humans are but one user of shared soil. Shared caretaking of soil and watershed areas surrounding either urban rural environments improves the overall ecosystem. All the creatures that are not humans -- from birds to fish to flora to fauna -- benefit from cleaner waters and soils. This philosophy is also known as Community Ecology. Being an Ecosteader involves systems-level thinking. With the advent of AI and technology, we know that smart systems require networking, and in order to best take a systems-level approach, people need to network. But wait! We're not talking about "networking" the traditional greed-driven ways that have driven the last 500 years of American real estate "development". Please read on... 

We are anti-Realtors, anti-landlords, and against corrupt politicians.
Instead, we promote practical, simple, and earth-friendly stewardship of lands, including nature preservation areas, habitat restoration areas, and America's public lands. We're supportive of efforts in county-level infrastructure, where laws and shared community vision and goals can be articulated and implemented by the residents themselves through democratic processes. We are also staunchly anti-HOA; HOAs divert what should be publicly-accountable taxpayer dollars into privately-managed coffers with little accountability, forcing residents to be governed under rules and bylaws that promote gerrymandering and exclusionary zoning that is harmful to ecosystems (golf courses and country “border walls” are harmful walls). They also destroy community spirit. Ecosteader & Company is a registered B Corp for "Public Benefit". We have a non-profit mission: to raise awareness of the ecological and economical benefits of ecosteading.
