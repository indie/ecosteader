An Ecosteader is one who recognizes that humans are but one user of shared soil. Shared 
caretaking of soil and watershed areas surrounding either urban rural environments improves 
the overall ecosystem. All the creatures that are not humans -- from birds to fish to flora 
to fauna -- benefit from cleaner waters and soils. This philosophy is also known as Community 
Ecology, and it is especially prevalent in Indigenous communities.

Being an Ecosteader involves systems-level thinking. With the advent of AI and technology, we 
know that “smart” systems require networking; and in order to best take a systems-level approach, 
people need to network. Network? Wait, we're not talking about "networking" the traditional 
greed-driven ways that have been evidenced with increasing frequency during the last 111 years 
of the United States of America. The acceleration of destruction has been increasing since 1908, 
when the “National Association of Real Estate Exchanges” was founded in Chicago, Illinois. This 
group later changed its name to the “National Association of Real Estate Boards”, and today is 
known as the “National Association of Realtors”.

## We are anti-Realtors, anti-landlords, and against corrupt politicians.

Instead, we promote practical, simple, and earth-friendly stewardship of lands, including 
natural preservation areas, habitat restoration areas, and America's public lands. We're 
supportive of efforts in county-level infrastructure, where laws and shared community vision 
and goals can be articulated and implemented by the residents themselves through democratic 
processes. We are also staunchly anti-HOA; HOAs divert what should be publicly-accountable 
taxpayer dollars into privately-managed coffers with no accountability, forcing residents to 
be governed under rules and bylaws that promote gerrymandering and exclusionary zoning that 
is harmful to ecosystems, such as with golf courses and walls. They also destroy community 
spirit.
